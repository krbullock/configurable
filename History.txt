=== 1.0.2 / 2011-05-10

* 1 minor enhancement

  * Default config is now accessible thru the generated Config module,
    as Config.defaults. The default_config method added to your class
    when you include Configurable is deprecated, but will continue to
    work (on both your class and instances of it).

=== 1.0.1 / 2011-05-06

* 2 bugfixes

  * to_args now returns a Hash with symbols as keys. This lets you pass
    your configuration directly to methods that expect option-style hash
    arguments.

  * to_args now excludes nil values from the resulting hash.

=== 1.0.0 / 2011-05-03
